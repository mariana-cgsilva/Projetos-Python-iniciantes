# Beginner Python Projects: Learning Repository

Welcome to my repository of beginner Python projects! This space was created with the aim of providing support to those who are just starting to explore this programming language. All available codes were developed by me, and as I continue to create new projects, I will add them here.

## How to Use:

Each project is organized into individual folders. Within each folder, you will find an explanatory text file and the corresponding codes.

### Text Files:

These documents aim to elucidate the idea behind each project, highlight the libraries used, and provide any other relevant information.

### Codes:

The codes available in this repository reflect my learning journey in Python. They should not be seen as definitive answers, but rather as my attempts to solve the proposed projects. If you find a better approach, please feel free to share it with me! :)
